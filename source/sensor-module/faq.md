# Frequently Asked Questions

I heard Simsense was open source. Where are the schematics and mechanical design?
: You are right, we plan to make Simsense open source. The schematics are not available yet, but if you feel brave you can [request access.](/sensor-module/schematics.html)

What sensors are available on Simsense?
: Our current generation of sensor module has 6 available sensors, each generating time-coded data. Curious? [Learn more about Simsense.](/sensor-module/sensor-module-documentation/simsense.html)

How do I know if my sensor module is working?
: Simple—if the [PPG](/sensor-module/sensor-module-documentation/simsense.html#ppg) LEDs are glowing, this means the sensor module is working and transmitting data to Simband.

Is it absolutely necessary to implement the [sensor module communication protocol](/sensor-module/sensor-module-documentation/sensor-module-communication-protocol/)?
: If you're working with Simband, then—yes.
