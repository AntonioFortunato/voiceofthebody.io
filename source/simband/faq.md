# Frequently Asked Questions

I heard Simband was open source. Where is the source code?
: You are right, we plan to make Simband open source. The source code is not available, yet, but if you feel brave you can [request access.](/simband/simband-documentation/simband-source-code.html)

Can I develop apps on Simband?
: Simband runs [Tizen](https://www.tizen.org/), and you can develop apps according to Tizen's standards. Our project focuses on building new, innovative sensor modules and using the data that comes out of those sensors. Developers are invited to write algorithms in C and C++ running on top of our Simband runtime that read, compute and save data in our [streams.](/simband/simband-documentation/semantics-of-simband/types-streams.html) Learn about [writing algorithms](/simband/simband-documentation/writing-algorithms-using-simband-api.html).

Can a algorithm developer get direct access to real-time data?

: Yes. You can access all the data from our [Data Collection Tool](/simband/simband-documentation/semantics-of-simband/applications.html#data-collection-tool) or from [SAMI](http://developer.samsungsami.io). We are also working on even cooler developer tool. [Stay tuned.](/simband/simband-changelog.html)

Can I use the SD card for storage and easier copy of data?

: We don't support SD cards, but the Simband prototype comes with a charger with a USB port. You can connect the USB port to your computer to transfer any files.

Who is behind Simband?

: Simband is the result of the work of a small, very energetic team. [Here we are](http://www.voiceofthebody.io/images/TeamPicture.png) two weeks before our November 2014 launch.
