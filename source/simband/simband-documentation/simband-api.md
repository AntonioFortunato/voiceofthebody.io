# Simband API

Note that this is not the final version of the API. We are still working on it and welcome your feedback.
{:.warning}

The Simband API is written in C. We have provided a C++11 wrapper with convenience functions to wrap around the C API. 

Simband's API enables you to access data from all the [available streams](/simband/simband-documentation/semantics-of-simband/types-streams.html) on the system, and to store newly computed algorithm data on new streams. 

The Simband API documentation is automatically generated from our software, thanks to doxygen.
